Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah created Zomato, an Indian restaurant aggregation and food delivery startup, in 2008. Zomato offers menus, user ratings, and details about restaurants. In some areas, it also offers food delivery services from its partner restaurants.

India is well-known for its wide variety of cuisine, which can be found in many eateries and resort hotels. This speaks to the idea of unity in diversity. In India, the restaurant industry is constantly changing. An increasing number of Indians are becoming receptive to the concept of dining out or ordering takeaway. The increasing quantity of eateries in every Indian state has spurred an examination of the data to obtain some fascinating insights, figures, and facts about the city's Indian food business. Thus, the analysis of Zomato restaurant data for every Indian city is the main goal of this study.


The project is focused on Customers and Businesses; you must evaluate the opinions expressed in the customer reviews in the data and provide some insightful visualisations in the form of conclusions. Additionally, group the Zomato eateries into several categories. As data analysis becomes instantaneous, the data is visualised. Additionally, the analysis resolves a few business cases that directly assist clients in locating the best restaurant in their area and enable the business to expand and compete in areas where it now lags.

This might facilitate the division of the eateries into groups. Additionally, the data contains insightful information about pricing and cuisine that may be applied to cost-benefit analyses.

An examination of sentiment using data is possible. Furthermore, industry critics can be identified using the metadata of reviewers.

Two Datasets are  present. The first dataset contains restaurant information, whereas the second dataset is a review of the restaurant.
